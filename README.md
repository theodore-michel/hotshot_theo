# hotshot_theo

This is the README file 


Info: 

  This is a local repo on my local pc into which i copy my codes for hotshot. 
  I keep this repo up to date with my hotshot and will often push to Github
  for other collaborators to keep up with what I am doing. This will also be
  a way for me to check in with collaborators on my code before submitting 
  jobs to Jean-Zay (training, testing, etc).
